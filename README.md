# selective-file

Here is an example of how you can implement a selective file uploader in JavaScript:

```
<form id="form" method="post" action="/upload">
  <input type="file" id="files" name="files" multiple />
  <input type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>

<script>
  const input = document.getElementById('files');
  const form = document.getElementById('form');

  input.addEventListener('change', () => {
    const files = input.files;
    // Only upload image files
    const imageFiles = [...files].filter(file => file.type.match(/image\/*/));
    input.files = imageFiles;
  });

  form.addEventListener('submit', event => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const files = input.files;
    // Do something with the selected files
  });
</script>
```

This code attaches an event listener to the file input element that filters out any files that are not image files when the user selects files. It also attaches an event listener to the form element that prevents the default form submission behavior and does something with the selected files when the form is submitted.

You can customize the code to fit your specific needs. For example, you can change the /upload action to the URL of your server-side file upload handler, and you can customize the code that is executed when the form is submitted to send the selected files to the server using an HTTP request.
